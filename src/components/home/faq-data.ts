    q: "What's the investment?",
    a: "<p><strong>Stage 1: €1,800 (4 weeks)</strong><br>Your entry into the program. We build your operating system — nutrition, training, and full support through the first month.</p><br><p><strong>Stages 2-4: €1,080/month (5 months)</strong><br>We refine based on what's working, solve roadblocks, and stress-test everything through real life — travel, dinners, schedule chaos.</p>",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from other programs?",
    a: "<p>Most programs are built for perfect conditions — meal prep, strict tracking, rigid schedules. This is built for chaos. You're not following a diet. You're learning principles that work in any restaurant, any gym, any situation. The goal isn't to give you rules. It's to make fitness intuitive.</p>",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to track my food?",
    a: "<p>Not long-term. Early on, we might use tracking as a teaching tool — to help you understand portions and build intuition. But the end goal is intuitive eating. You'll know how to make smart decisions without a calculator.</p>",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I travel constantly?",
    a: "<p>Perfect. That's exactly who this is built for. We'll teach you how to train in hotel gyms, how to order at any restaurant, and how to stay consistent when conditions aren't perfect. Travel doesn't break the system — it's where the system gets tested and refined.</p>",
  },
  {
    q: "How much time does this require?",
    a: "<p>2-3 hours of training per week. 30min-1h of coaching calls per week. Plus unlimited WhatsApp access when you need support. This isn't a second job. It's designed to fit into your existing schedule.</p>",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I have an injury or limitation?",
    a: "<p>We work around it. Every program is personalized. If something doesn't work for your body, we find what does. The goal is progress without pain — training that challenges your muscles, not your joints.</p>",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this just for weight loss?",
    a: "<p>No. This is for building a body that performs, looks good, and feels sustainable. Whether that's losing fat, building muscle, or both — we optimize for your goal. But the real outcome is freedom. You'll know how your body works and what to do in any situation.</p>",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after 6 months?",
    a: "<p>You're independent. The goal is to make myself obsolete. You'll have the operating system. You'll know how to eat, train, and adapt. Some clients continue working together to push further. Others move on because they're equipped to thrive on their own.</p>",
