# Website Audit — Founder Athlete OS

_Prepared on the `claude/dazzling-galileo-gqwqtb` branch. Scope: full-site code
& design audit, with the **hero section** refactored as a worked example of the
standard. Priority lens: **conversion / bookings**._

---

## Executive summary

The honest verdict: **this is a solid, well-built site — not garbage.** Next.js 15
+ Tailwind v4, statically exported to Cloudflare Pages, content-driven, with error
boundaries, lazy-loaded sections, year-long asset caching, and **zero literal inline
`style={{}}` hacks.** We are not rescuing a mess; we are taking a B+ to flawless.

The real flaws are the subtle, structural kind — the difference between code that
*works* and a system that *scales without drift*. Four themes, in priority order:

| # | Finding | Severity | Status this branch |
|---|---------|----------|--------------------|
| 1 | Typography copy-pasted, not centralized | High (maintainability) | ✅ Fixed (foundation) |
| 2 | Accessibility gaps (contrast, focus, motion) | High (a11y + reach) | ✅ Fixed (hero + global) |
| 3 | `lever.png` shipped at 1.8 MB | High (performance) | ✅ Fixed |
| 4 | Two undocumented color systems | Medium (clarity) | ✅ Documented |

Everything below the hero is **teed up but not yet applied** — see _Rollout_.

## 1. Typography was copy-pasted, not a system  ·  HIGH

**Problem.** The same heading recipe —
`text-[15.5vw] md:text-[8rem] font-black uppercase tracking-tighter leading-[0.85]`
— was hardcoded independently in `HeroSection`, `FinalCTASection`, and (in a sibling
form) `SectionHeader` and ~8 other files. Two failure modes:

- **No single source of truth.** Changing the display scale means editing ~11 files
  and hoping none are missed. That is how design drift starts.
- **Abrupt breakpoint jump.** `15.5vw` (≈ 56px at 360px) snaps to a fixed `8rem`
  (128px) at the `md` breakpoint with nothing in between — the headline visibly
  "pops" as the viewport crosses 768px.

**Fix (this branch).** A fluid, named type scale lives in **one place**
(`src/app/globals.css`) as Tailwind v4 `@utility` classes built on `clamp()`:
`text-display`, `text-h2`, `text-lead`, `text-lead-lg`, `text-eyebrow`. Each bakes in
size + line-height + tracking + weight + transform, so a component writes
`className="text-display text-white"` instead of a five-token string. The scale is
now continuous (no jump) and editable in one location.

**Why it matters for conversion.** Consistent hierarchy is what makes a page feel
*premium and trustworthy* — and trust is what gets the call booked.

## 2. Accessibility gaps  ·  HIGH

- **Contrast.** `text-white/40` on `--bleu-nuit (#09071D)` for the hero social proof
  is ~3:1 — below the WCAG AA 4.5:1 floor for body-size text. **Fixed:** bumped to
  `/70`; subheadlines standardized to `/80` minimum. Rule going forward: never below
  `/70` for body text on the dark navy.
- **Keyboard focus.** `CTAButton` had no visible focus ring — keyboard users couldn't
  see the booking button. **Fixed once, site-wide:** a `focus-visible` ring added to
  the shared `baseClasses`, so every CTA on every page benefits.
- **Motion.** `scroll-behavior: smooth` and transform hovers ran for everyone,
  including users with vestibular sensitivity. **Fixed:** a global
  `prefers-reduced-motion` guard neutralizes smooth scroll and the brutalist hover
  translate for users who opt out.

**Why it matters for conversion.** Accessibility is reach. Every visitor who can't
tab to (or comfortably use) the CTA is a lost booking — and it's an SEO/legal risk.

## 3. `lever.png` was 1.8 MB  ·  HIGH

A single trust-bar logo shipped at **2500×952 px / 1.84 MB** — larger than the entire
transformations folder — to display at ~80 px wide. **Fixed:** re-encoded to
**320×122 / 10.7 KB (−99.4%)**, now consistent with the other logos. ~1.8 MB shaved
off every first visit, directly improving Largest Contentful Paint on the trust bar.

Everything else is already healthy: transformations are WebP, fonts use
`display: swap` + preload, and `_headers` sets 1-year immutable caching.

## 4. Two undocumented color systems  ·  MEDIUM

`globals.css` carried a shadcn **OKLCh** token set (`--background`, `--foreground`…)
*and* a hex **neo-brutalist brand** set (`--bleu-*`). They don't collide, but nothing
said which to use where — an invitation for a future contributor to cross-wire them
and accidentally restyle the error pages. **Fixed:** a header comment documents the
split — OKLCh is **internal-only** (body defaults + ErrorReporter), `--bleu-*` is
**canonical** for all marketing UI. No values changed; brand colors untouched.

---

## The hero, as the worked example

`src/components/home/sections/HeroSection.tsx` was rebuilt to demonstrate the standard
without changing the brand look:

- **Conversion-first hierarchy:** social-proof eyebrow → headline → subheadline →
  **one** primary CTA → risk-reversal microcopy ("45 minutes, 1:1 with me. No pitch
  if we're not a fit.") placed exactly where hesitation peaks — right under the button.
- Consumes the new `text-display` / `text-lead` / `text-eyebrow` utilities.
- Contrast, focus, and mobile padding fixed; the rotated highlight span is constrained
  so it can't clip on small screens.
- Copy still lives in `src/data/homepage-content.ts` (new `riskReversal` field) — the
  content-as-code discipline is preserved.

## Rollout (next, after sign-off on the hero)

The foundation makes the rest mechanical:

1. Swap the hardcoded type strings in `FinalCTASection`, `SectionHeader`, and the
   remaining ~8 sections to `text-display` / `text-h2` / `text-lead*`.
2. Convert the 26 testimonial JPGs (~2.4 MB) to WebP.
3. Sweep remaining low-contrast utilities (`/40`, `/60` on small text) site-wide.
4. Consider Cloudflare Image Resizing to drop `unoptimized` for true responsive srcset.
